## 4. (Developer) How to build

### 4.1. Folder structure

Put the repository on your local folder. folder path should not include space character.

Open Unity project with Unity 2022.3.x, and open WPF project with Visual Studio 2022.

Maintainer's environment is as following.

* Unity 2022.3.7f1 Personal
* Visual Studio Community 2022 (17.4.4)
    * Component ".NET Desktop Development" is required.
    * Also Component "C++ Desktop Development" is required, for Unity Burst compiler.

### 4.2. Asset install

* [FinalIK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/final-ik-14290)
* [Dlib FaceLandmark Detector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/dlib-facelandmark-detector-64314)
* [OpenCV for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-for-unity-21088)
* [Oculus LipSync Unity Integration v29](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-lipsync-unity/)
* [VRMLoaderUI](https://github.com/m2wasabi/VRMLoaderUI/releases) v0.3
* [Zenject](https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject) (from Asset Store)
* SharpDX.DirectInput 4.2.0
    * [SharpDX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpDX)
    * [SharpDX.DirectInput](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpDX.DirectInput/)
* [RawInput.Sharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RawInput.Sharp/) 0.0.3
* [uWindowCapture](https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture) v1.0.2
* DOTween (from Asset Store)
* [Fly,Baby. ver1.2](https://nanakorobi-hi.booth.pm/items/1629266)
* [LaserLightShader](https://noriben.booth.pm/items/2141514)
* [VMagicMirror_MotionExporter](https://github.com/malaybaku/VMagicMirror_MotionExporter)
* [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)

Should be noted that `FinalIK`, `Dlib FaceLandmark Detector`, and `OpenCV for Unity` are paid assets.

[NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity) is necessary to import [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).

"Fly,Baby." and "LaserLightShader" are available on BOOTH, and they are optional. If you do not introduce them, some of typing effects will not work correctly.

Dlib FaceLandmark Detector requires dataset file to be moved into `StreamingAssets` folder. Please check the file is in correct location by running Dlib FaceLandmark Detector example scenes like `WebCamTexture Example`.

Install SharpDX by following steps.

- From 2 URLs get `.nupkg` file by `Download package`, and expand them as zip file.
- In the expanded zip, see `lib/netstandard1.3/` to get file `SharpDX.dll` and `SharpDX.DirectInput.dll`. Put these file in anywhere on the Unity project.

RawInput.Sharp can be installed with almost same work flow.

- Get `.nupkg` from NuGet gallery and expand as zip to get `lib/netstandard1.1/RawInput.Sharp.dll`
- Create `RawInputSharp` folder in Unity project's Assets folder, and put dll into the folder.

For OpenCVforUnity, edit `DisposableOpenCVObject.cs`: 

```
    abstract public class DisposableOpenCVObject : DisposableObject
    {

//        internal IntPtr nativeObj;
        //Change to public member
        public IntPtr nativeObj;

```

Also there are some UPM based dependencies.

* [UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM) v0.66.0
* [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
* [KlakSpout](https://github.com/keijiro/KlakSpout)
* [MidiJack](https://github.com/malaybaku/MidiJack)
    * This is fork repository and not the original.

You will get compile errors for the first time. To solve this, confirm `NuGetForUnity` is installed, and open `NAudioLipSyncContext.cs` to uncomment `#define` line at the start of the script. This will solve compile errors and NuGet download will start. After download completed, comment out the line to enable actual lipsync implementation.

```
//uncomment this line once, and comment out after NAudio is downloaded
#define TEMP_SUPPRESS_ERROR
```

### 4.3. Build

### 4.3.1. Build by Cmd Files

Build operation is available by `.cmd` files in `Batches` folder.

Please see what args are supported in each files.

For Unity build, you have to prepare required assets beforehand, and note that Unity Editor version is strictly specified in `build_unity.cmd`.
If you have some reason to use different version of editor, you need to modify `build_unity.cmd`.

Note that, `create_installer.cmd` requires [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to be installed.

```
# Build WPF project
build_wpf.cmd standard dev

# Build Unity project
build_unity.cmd standard dev

# Call after building WPF and Unity project to make installer
create_installer.cmd standard dev v1.2.3

# Build and create installer, with version name written in "version.txt"
job_release_instraller.cmd
```

### 4.3.2. Build on Opened Project

Prepare output folder like `Bin`. Following instruction expects the folder name is `Bin`, but of course you can specify other name.

* In Unity,
    - Specify `Bin` folder for the output.
* To build WPF project, right click `VMagicMirrorConfig` project on the solution explorer and select `publish`.
    - Use following profile setting as `Folder Profile`.
        - Configuration: `Release | x86`
        - Target Framework: `netcoreapp3.0`
        - Deployment Mode: `Self Contained`
        - Target Runtime: `win10-x86`
        - Target Location: choose somewhere on your PC folder
    - By the publish you will get the files at target location folder. Then, copy the files to `Bin/ConfigApp/` folder.

When you want to check right folder structure, please see the distributed app.
