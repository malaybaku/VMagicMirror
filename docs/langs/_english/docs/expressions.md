# Expressions

This page is about how to control face expression (and a few motions) in VMagicMirror.

This feature is called `Word to Motion`.

#### Overview
{: .doc-sec2 }

`Word to Motion` is the function to control avatar's facial and motion expressions.

Originally this feature supports receiving word input (e.g. "joy") to emotional expression, but now it also supports several input styles, as you would expect.

<div class="doc-ul" markdown="1">

1. Keyboard, word input base
2. Gamepad, button input
3. Keyboard, number key
4. MIDI Controller

</div>

<div class="row">
{% include docimg.html file="/images/docs/word_to_motion_top.png" customclass="col s12 m6 l6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
{% include docimg.html file="/images/docs/word_to_motion_by_gamepad.png" customclass="col s12 m6 l6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
</div>

The example above shows `Device Assignment` selected to `Gamepad` and press `Y` button to launch `fun` expression.

You can sort items by up/down buttons at the left of each items, and can delete them by right `x` button.

To add and custom item, take the following steps.

<div class="doc-ul" markdown="1">

1. Press `+` button to add a new item. If you custom existing item, skip it.
2. Press `Setting` button to open the setting.
3. In the custom window you can setup motion and face blend shape.
4. Press `OK` to confirm your custom.

</div>

<div class="row">
{% include docimg.html file="/images/docs/word_to_motion_custom_flow.png" customclass="col s12 m6 l6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
{% include docimg.html file="/images/docs/word_to_motion_custom_window.png" customclass="col s12 m6 l6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
</div>

In custom window you can take 4 actions.

<div class="doc-ul" markdown="1">

1. Set the word to start this item. If you do not use `Keyboard (word)` mode, then this work just for the name label.
2. Select motion type for this item. 
    * In v1.5.0 and older version only supports 3 built-in motions. If you do not need any motions and only need facial expression, then select `None` motion.
    * v1.6.0 and later version supports custom motion import feature. See detail at [Use Custom Motion](../../tips/use_custom_motion) tips.
3. Face expression setting.
    * Turn on `Enable Face Expression` check to play some face expression in this item.
    * `Duration when Body Motion is None [sec]` defines how long the avatar keep the face.
    * `Keep LipSync active` enables lipsync during the face expression is applied, for the blendshape without mouth motion.
    * If `Keep face after motion` is on, then avatar face does not change after the duration.
4. Set BlendShapes. 
    * **NOTE:** Basically, set only one blend shape to non-zero, and set other values to zero.

#### Hint
{: .doc-sec2 }

`Keyboard (word)` in `Device Assignment`: Please do NOT type special keys like Control/Shift/Alt during input word. When the typing is too slow, the word input is not recognized.

`Gamepad` in `Device Assignment`: When you select this option, the gamepad gripping motion is disabled.

`Keyboard (num 0-8)` in `Device Assignment`: When you select this option, the typing motion and touch pad motion is ignored.

`Keep face after motion` in custom window: If you use this option the face expression does not reset automatically, so you should have reset item. In default setting `reset` item works as you want.
