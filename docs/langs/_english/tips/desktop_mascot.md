# Tips: Use as Desktop Mascot

VMagicMirror is also available as a desktop mascot software.

To start `VMagicMirror` automatically on Windows startup, please take the following steps.

1. Setup basic [Getting Started](../../get_started) to show your avatar and setup background transparency, and so on.
2. On the control panel `Home` tab, confirm the `Load current VRM on next startup` check is on.
3. In the control panel `Home` tab, check on `Start on Windows startup` at the left bottom side. 

After the setup, you can check if the thing goes good to restart Windows.

When you replace the VMagicMirror with different version, or want to disable automatic startup, then turn off `Start on Windows startup` check.
