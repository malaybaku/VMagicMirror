# Tips: Use VMagicMirror for Presentation

In control panel `Streaming` tab, at `Motion` item, check on `Presentation-like hand` to enable presentation like right hand motion.

This feature is, in short, the feature to point the mouse pointer position by right hand.

You can integrate this feature with presentation in many ways.

In this section there are 3 steps to create presentation with VMagicMirror.

#### Check slide layout
{: .doc-sec2 }

We should check the slide layout to avoid conflict with the presentation and the character.

Please keep right-bottom side of the slide blank to put character.

It will be also impressive if it is not blank but a wiped window or some room-like background.

Slide page number also should NOT be at right bottom so move them to left bottom side etc.

You can combinate your character and right top side of the slide.

* Serifu text
* Comic-like signs ("漫符" in Japanese)

Though written in Japanese, the following video also will be hints for you.

#### VMagicMirror Setup
{: .doc-sec2 }

* Setup according to [Get Started](../../get_started)
* Check on `Presentation-like hand`, then you are ready to adjust your character's motion.

To adjust the right arm motion:

Open setting window from control panel `Home` tab > `Open setting window`, and select `Motion` tab.

See `Arm` menu, and if the right arm goes in character's body, increase `Arm position radius min[cm]`.
    
That's all! Now you are ready for the presetation.

If you want further custom, please see [Motion](../../docs/motion) and [Effects](../../docs/effects).

#### Presentation
{: .doc-sec2 }

During the presentation move the mouse to control character's hand motion.

If your tool for the presentation is Microsoft PowerPoint, then right-click over the slide show mode slide then you will see `Pointer Option` and `Laser Pointer` like option to switch the mouse pointer appearance. It helps the expression.

**Hint:** Though it is a bit difficult, try to move the mouse by left hand, and physically points your right arm to slide. As a result, you and the character points the slide at same time (as if your arm motion is captured).
